EasyConomy is a set two ideas / apps that can be implemented indipendently and make our economy flourish from person to person skills and goods exchange


Smartphone app / Similar to todo list app

you put everything you need or thing you spend a relevant amount of money in your month

basic one (almost everyone has them):
- food
- rent
- car / bike
- phone bills


like for me:

- computer
- hardware parts
- solar
- sensors
- arduino



----------------------

Example: for selling and shipping food



person to person exchange (shipped / virtual order) means no third parties are involved in the transaction
